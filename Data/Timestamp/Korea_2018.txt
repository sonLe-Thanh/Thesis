fascinating phenomenon start point specified road stopped car put car neutral released brake car started move slowly forward slope inside car road slope yet car like rolling slope neutral gear fascinating must try self driving
definitely mysterious road defy law gravity car neutral gear foot accelerator car actually go uphill road
interestingly nice mysterious enough wonder started make one tourist attraction apart mysterious nothing much see
mysterious road dokkaebi road drive pleasant passed many scenic place saw home unique design start mysterious road taxi driver switch engine let car roll road wondering could happen witness vehicle taxi driver took bottle water pour middle road water didnt flow backward group chinese tourist thing guide say scam truth optic illusion nice backdrop mount hallasan
road experience gained though name make mysterious people become curious doesnt really add experience worth hype creates
excited enjoyed road nothing espectacular turn engine place bus neutral bus move going little hill
overated attraction many tour include spot tourist personally find rated illusionary experience environs surrounding particular stretch road give one impression supposed guide would even spill water road experiment interesting yes would include part tour itinerary
hit miss went see something probably hit miss place unless time there nice cafe huge garden though
enroute visited mysterious road return journey hallasan tried rolling water bottle failed lol eventually touristy thing shutting car engine letting car roll slope interesting
almost missed missed make detour find signage co tour bus blocking road alot tourist student arrived myth true roll upwards
mysterious road trip slight detour place returing airport road pretty empty except one 2 car already u turn face slope got followed sign start put neutral experience pull slope 200 300m stretch turned carpark beside shop really feel anything strange excited
spare time eye level short stretch looked like upward sloping road actually 3 degree downhill slant bit way would recommend making trip unless jeju si enroute hallasan national park many mysterious bottle rolling uphill video posted youtube case want see mystery real attraction huge iconic black pig family statue detailed incredible lol
funny friend went local guy show u mystery group friend found quite funny car rolled downhill looked impossible think boring go along short stretch road nothing spectacular fun visit area would make trip go specific attraction
illusion illusion make see road going upwards fact gravity show going downwards interesting
believe tried putting water bottle see bottle roll downhill errmmmm yeahhh disappointed anyway
optical illusion good visit place understanding happening optical illusion dokkaebi road story behind discovery short road distance 150m start ending point
interesting road using bare eye look road appears go actually going downhill put water bottle road slide interesting
fun visit area place outside love land huge parking lot behind row shop front shop selling sausage fruit road borrow bottle water row road miraculously come stop row backwards opposite road grazing field see cow ok visit area
fascinating young kid 4 year old found road fascinating kept mentioning mysterious road throughout day probably average experience adult travelling little one may worthwhile spend time bring kid view road
rolling upward hill interesting place eye trick surroundings worth go intentionally
beautiful stretch mysterious road dokkaebi road beautiful stretch road right middle forest
small interesting interesting mysterious trick eye surroundings anyway fun little detour make good video picture show student back state
worth detour close went detour sure tiny bit interesting would recomend detour many fabolous place island spend time instead
pas street take look need something like le 50 meter road strange situation worthed intentionally go
fun time defying odds heard immediately thought come see initially took bottle thinking place road shy drive car bottle light wind actually moving instead saw ppl came suggested put car neutral step accelerator car move forward despite uphill road twice there much car around
car really move uphill interseting see car move uphill engine tour guide explained reason behind still understand xd try pour water thing happened
car roll uphill interesting road way jeju city hallasan havent quite figure certain stretch car actually roll upwards neutral gear without brake probably optical illusion didnt stay figure better take mysterious road interesting there statue pig nearby symbolizing prosperity many child take picture touch pig head
interesting visit switch car engine experience rolling upward tour group guide visited saw demonstration water flowing upstream water bottle roll upstream interesting switch car engine witness car rolling upwards
nice visit pas place try observe mysterious road well kinda get coaster anymore since driver show already u
mysterious drive nice experience require stop car change gear n feel car start moving slowly even though sloop
meh underwhelming needed stop interesting shop nearby persimmon mushroom think total loss worth detour
really fooled mistery road half kilometer long stop youre vehicle start road put gear neutral turn engine car slowly climb pretty steep slope least look like upward slope really hard believe upward slope optical illusion reality slope seen magnetic hill moncton canada road like mountain slope optical illusion understandable thing plain stretch road really could figure eye deceiving brain big deal worth experiencing jeju
road road stand poured water dropped coin usually stay place road move road straight
misterious arrive jeju misterious road go bus private car use private car try misterious road go bus need walk arrive jeju misterious road
quite interesting start sign stop sign upon reaching start sign switch neutral gear hazard light keep car engine start move forward uphill slope slowly course alert keep eye infront foot hover brake necessary one lane traffic car stopping wow nature force might honked driver slowing anti gravity act well ignore move cutting lane convenient shop next car park park car come try half filled water bottle perform rolling slope however beware car still coming traffic
point unless passing car seems pointless search road even see many car staying couple minute people seemed bemused
strange true taxi driver took u going horseland way better horse place driver switched ignition placed neutral rolled hill rather odd experience passing definitely worth experience
fun go remember turn hazard light neutral gear wrong direction may roll backwards uphill lol beware impatient local speeding hy
good experience manage visit mysterious road way going hallasan unable try road road really mysterious length road long try road using mineral bootleg water really awesome try visit curious road

start sign drove using waze got start signage point beside road try put gear neutral move short drive like 1 2 minute park car near 7 eleven use restroom
strange fun quite confuse tour leader brought u experiment road downward hill look like incline understand happen bottle keep moving upward
nothing special eye perspective view see car slowly run machine road actually go nothing special
nothing shout ok road look like hill car move forward opinion skip unless way road one car started honing u slow later turn love museum rushingly
magic road fascinating 100m car rolled neutral road flat bottle water rolling backward go water poured ground
