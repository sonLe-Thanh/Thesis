better zoo go neo park read post concurred view miss place admission ticket cheap charge activity park feeding animal fish playing animal kid already teen actually spend le 1 5 hr park quite run well kept enjoyed feeding bird fish fun time together rest park pathetic able find better zoo animal bird park go however staff professional helpful chritmas season take pic reindeer near exit park free
dated place need refresh park quite dated entrance park swamped many many bird droppings realised train ride beside park backtracked train ride rather nice concept state park need refresh wanted visit petting zoo ended leaving train ride toddler fell asleep midway pretty spectacular attraction prime quite pity
still good park close personal still enjoy going see animal bird close personal feeding walking park lot bird animal free roaming within reach hand feed petting zoo portion different still interesting food feed anmials sale different part park change pay
old park animal plant bit old entry fee expensive hence still good visiting family kid natural style walk pas animal open area kid happy
one best family park okinawa kid must gone park least ten time inexpensive park rewarding gone minor change year back like said tkae family never disappointed
nice place like close animal place boring like close animal bird walk close animal rather come see food hand get animal feed 200 yen start feeding bird animal petting zoo requires separate entry fee rabbit guinea pig dog hour time limit paid animal feed 200 yen small tub start feeding
everything requires extra fee nice park interesting animal globally getting old would need deep refurbishment addition almost attraction inside require extra fee really deserve
incredible tour highlight visit okinawa get close encounter many animal stood right next peacock feather fanned hand fed little wallaby enjoyable visited july 2015
unlike zoo let kid really touch feed animal skeptical read prior review glad went everything possibly include train ride extra animal exhibit great petting area feed kind thing even pet walk different dog large field back fish lake would totally recommend park fun way spend 3 4 hour make sure bring lot yen take card u feed animal
thought would read enough make sure bring cash card accepted wanted grandson see monkey giant tortoise exhibit extra enough cash u also walking right bird expecting fed little scary little one prepared see nice felt bad suggesting
interesting place take kid squeamish probably give 3 5 truth several time guest taken thing say place interesting much bird poop yes prepared hose shoe leave get past great place get close personal exotic bird facility little tired looking sure son enjoyed important thing done beach aquarium looking something nago definitely say one top 5 attraction area

nice place roam around classified zoo enjoy walking ground lot animal mostly bird interact bet kid love place could use care still go every year least couple time year
education place kid nice interesting collection bird animal special area additional charge applies allow interaction small rodent animal worth visit
fun 2 yr old really enjoyed zoo kind small many area get chance interact animal daughter ride 16 yr old turtle train ride worth u saw whole zoo time reached train end route train gave sitting view every turn also pay extra something view section bird bird animal food etc 200 300 yen still
quite dirty zoo end october look like absence care japanese make better animal look quite dirty ueno zoo tokyo much better think seems living natural condition
place cool
