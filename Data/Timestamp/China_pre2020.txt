2 panda gave reviewed live closeby kai kai previous resident panda left building 2 new panda residence feeding time 3 4pm best chance see playing walking around remember sleep lot also bird aviary walk see bird also kid area make toy panda panda enclosure fully air conditioned great macau summer
small think panda park big actually extremely small quite disappointed went panda park panda sleeping nothing else see
find lucky well almost panda life large pavilion hide crowd like chance see close probably lower zoo
waste time sadly place actually bit far urban area macau take bus get taxi panda pavilion fact inside nature park admission free good range small park including monkey gorilla flamingo herb garden etc highlight panda pavilion crowd control seems fine many visitor staff start telling people stop using flash camera overall quiet little place great relaxing point good small group couple
peaceful panda enclosure passing visiting cultural village tin hau temple goddess statue hill cheap get quiet visited fact people panda enclosure apart one security guard panda looked somewhat bored wandering around aimlessly pleasant see although cute characteristic face ok see passing make special trip
nice couple kid people love animal quiet calm place variety animal panda monkey lemures parrot deer macau long time 3rd time go see panda 1st one actually saw moving place lot people saw eating unlucky really see well ticket admission panda pavillion cheap 10mop something like 1eur recommend small child love animal rush passing macau place go last visit 17 00pm nice souvenir shop lot panda toy shirt place eat poor lot food juice choose
cute macau giant panda pavillion great place kid really enjoyed seeing panda nurtered enjoyed lot
panda good culture better
definitely worth hour time feeding time 14 00 panda captivity especially outside china felt must go see panda since five minute drive away animal see including cute ring tailed lemur obviously panda main attraction lucky enough catch feeding time 14 00 15 00 could see active enjoying bamboo brilliant experience panda seemed well looked content lot else keep entertained although area extremely tranquil welcome change extremely busy cotai strip also worth mentioning see panda charge 10 hong kong dollar le 1 pound sterling absolute bargain
make sure expectation realistic panda inactive creature sadly one two resident panda xin xin died last summer leaving u one panda kai kai macau giant panda pavilion unfortunate panda inactive two panda much better chance seeing least one action one panda odds great see kai kai sleeping laying around kai kai always seemed lazy opinion active fed happen visit time see moving around bit otherwise likely going see laying around nothing enjoy stopping see mop10 one hour good way spend 1 2 hour even inactive time winter month let use outdoor enclosure well interested visit kai kai macau giant panda pavilion great opportunity see panda modern enclosure make sure expectation realistic visit try feel disappointed kai kai much note planning visit hong kong well might prefer visit ocean park panda village see handful panda providing much improved chance seeing panda moving around active
great hour

quiet spacious garden one panda view time asleep rest park garden nice explore especially child
small nice quiet
poor staff rude un helpful panda pavilion 1 lonely panda sleep time behind rock animal poorly kept cage smelling strongly urine
worth visit top range zoo need accept offer panda pavillon well maintained get really see panda also busy space good family three small child two elderly grandparent u felt relaxed two three hour hung
ok two three panda kept air conditioned pavilion missed short time 10 minute taxi ride cotai
first panda first time seen panda great able get close see kai kai clearly 20 mop able access attraction taxi one large hotel caught local bus back simple process
worth visiting
cheap place toddler wow 20mop get spend quality time panda area lamars chimp parrot small animal much well maintained park great place kid run around good weather worried catching cab back hotel 5 bus route ran problem definately recommend place morning afternoon away hussle macau casino hotel
panda animal nice walking path forest several public bus going bus stop close entrance fee ridiculously cheap panda animal see many zoo many atractions macau good spot true maybe panda sleeping get see also expect anything entertaining sleeping eating get stay enclosure one hour hopefully lucky see time see make couple photo go away ten minute great walk around area forest path lead enclosure hour walk maybe get lucky see panda people generally try silent extremely noisy animal zoo many different bird deer monkey ostrich look sad bored since cage small indeed improved also plant area interested medicinal herb example panda museum kid adult couple museum related plant animal small cafe offer much term food coffee ok gift shop nice non expensive tshirts sort mostly panda inspired souvenir lot building around noise green jem construction sight interesting place visit especially never seen panda walk really nice try
luxurious playground panda park located coloane island good getaway noisy crowded casino also museum animal park panda pavilion requires 10 mop get also hiking trail top hill cultural village originally 2 panda named kai kai xin xin mean happiness unfortunately xin xin died june 2013 park still received another female panda china lonely kai kai inside full air conditioning room desperately need love best time visit 3 30pm 4 30pm feeding time see active juggling eating bamboo climbing good luck
visit giant panda macau steal 10 mop panda pavilion lovely panda nice watch ate played one panda recently died sad mean one giant panda moment place could spruce happening like cage monkey bird big enough come visit recommend make sure know catch bus back impossible call taxi macau price good something different apart gamble bus stop right outside

place feel happy panda lover must go scratch want smile looking something ridiculously cute go hong kong could spend hkd 150 visit ocean park spend hkd 10 see panda close tired casino bad run come recharge battery regret unfortunately 1 panda went sister apparently died 2 week visited due illness look kinda lonely sad
good kid see really giant panda macau giant panda pavilion main attraction seeing panda good kid panda real trip place really worth little known attraction outside main tourist area macau city
unique sadly underrated macau giant panda pavilion seemingly little known attraction outside main tourist area cotai strip macau city although short taxi ride cotai great deal see pavillion offer unique attraction able get close observe giant panda without throng screaming tourist bustling getting way ten dollar mop hkd visitor gain entry pavilion one hour viewing slot allowing uninterrupted close viewing panda glorious air con ten people pavilion u visited comparison comparable panda attraction ocean park hong kong far better experience absurdly low cost well panda pavilion park animal including ostrich bird lively monkey ape free charge view would advise avoiding walk aviary unless want get bitten death mosquito sadly one panda used housed macau recently dy still alive well highly recommended macau giant panda pavilion allows unrivalled view fascinating animal
never seen panda sole purpose attraction seeing panda ticket sold seperate session thus every session bamboo placed panda come munch finishing panda went back sleep rest repeating many session long panda kind got bored bother watching living routine life behind glass seems cruel especially one left place really middle nowhere either take taxi learn ride public bus case took scenic route went around housing estate neighbourhood bus good side close way lord stow restaurant hunting famous tart originator
worth mission get made trip place absolutely worth open tuesday sunday ie open monday unless monday bank holiday case also open tuesday essentially make sure going open go open 9 30 5 take bus 50 ferry terminal apparently much easier get taxi expensive get bus back though far venician casino feed panda 10am hightly recommend getting 10 panda awake feeding time non touristy well maintained large place seems genuinely trying right thing panda
treat kid grandchild enjoyed watching panda well grown ups pity partner passed away alone
panda place 2 panda one passed away recently many animal including emu giraffe monkey couple play ground kid run wild
nothing special 2 giant panda pavilion however nothing special park would like suggest go ocean park located hong kong much animal fish see
panda missing place located middle nowhere taxi public transport cotai strip 1 5 km away around 13 00 closed lunch
