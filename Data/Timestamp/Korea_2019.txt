good trek mostly enjoyed hike hallasan moderate climb despite highest peak korea important note still need crampon climb right hotel went told u didnt need snow left well wrong steepest slope trail still sheer ice quite treacherous without crampon help grip good hike crater top pretty cool also note even clear day really hazy distance view top wasnt expected still worth though recommend starting early get first bus morning trail becomes quite crowded later
need know go climbed hallasan twice december early march time took route route slightly longer gwaneumsa also gradual incline several easy portion took route primarily lot public transportation available gwaneumsa trail plus sure steep incline entire way summit seongpanak 5 km easy 2 5 km get harder pretty brutal last 2 km regardless know hiking trail around island even around volcano two mentioned lead way summit given review saw either inaccurate helpful hope compile quick list help decide something want need 1 definitely going day kind thing tired afterward likely want schedule many activity evening also likely sore tired next day two 2 need start climbing later 8 30 several people mentioned allowed access last chunk way second shelter 12 30 pm winter time schedule varies slightly season season always check korean tourism site 3 even sunny chance might need crampon winter month need sure even last weekend people sliding falling repeatedly without hear even worse gwaneumsa trail since lot shielded sunshine 4 bring food water place buy something beginning trail even option fantastic little protein fruit go long way whenever starting feel tired help push please make sure leave trash along way zero trashcans carry something particularly messy might want pack bag waste 5 use toilet first shelter worst smelling bathroom ever rare korea since thing usually clean suppose septic system suggest using toilet parking lot last shelter two first one seriously nightmare 6 easy hike doable even people exercise strenuously seen people carrying baby way top seen small child old people make definitely wear right clothing though especially right shoe hiking time without snow spend hour circumventing rock size ankle support extremely helpful anyway thanks reading hope fantastic hike
descending trail ascended via gwaneumsa trail descended via seongpanak trail easier knee another advantage entrance exit seongpanak bus stop back jeju city seogwipo initial plan take cab back jeju city surprisingly wasnt cab around sure due low peak season december took bus 281 jeju city bus terminal fare 1150 journey 40 min
mt hallasan hike suggest start early 7am started 7am managed reach summit 1pm descend 1 30pm took total 10 hour hike anybody else lifetime experience remember proper warm starting bring along enough water hydrate proper hiking shoe important hiking stick definitely helpful
