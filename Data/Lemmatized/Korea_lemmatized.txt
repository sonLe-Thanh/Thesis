leisurely crater view considering crater type view seongsan ilchulbang sunrise peak hallasan way seaside formation yongmeori coast slippery path jumping sam gumburi crater nice leisurely one place seemed wheelchair friendly also le crowded compared seongsan illchulbang really got enjoy nice leisurely walk small hill see crater faster walker could probably whole thing le hour needle say lazy walker took little hour wanted roam could spend lot time well different path one stair one like ramp etc anyways probably geological tourist attraction wheelchair friendly even seemed front rental ramp would bit steep least able lot site either lot stair walking way many people elderly others bad knee maneuver well perhaps saw number couple stroller said place one pricy admission cost encountered privately owned something instead usual 1 000 2 000krw per person paid 6 000krw per person told place nicer reed season enjoyed crater recommended anyone looking jeju geotourist site without hard work
beautiful place worth price place best visit november december gramineae full bloom however paying 6000 enter place much nothing else make sure come clear day best view hallasan mountain
interesting recommended visit crater one kind tree greenery grows crater supposed rare overrun foreign tour group local tour group cost rather high krw6 000 one highest paid natural tourist attraction frankly think worth money one kind thingy guess visit go seongsan ilchbong

crater overlook really cool view absolutely beautiful admired tourist took picture went various shop nice watch people go stair view
simply breathtaking
extinct volcano quite walk going crater 2 way get one gradually using concrete stair otther one plain path anyway high view compensates effort also get see field pampas grass along thw way beautiful
pretty enough deal breaker stop
pretty place boring far crater go whilst whole area quite picturesque expect anything mind blowing crater boring found interested tourist posing building made completely oddly shaped lava stone must see stretch
uninteresting crater seen quite crater around world im always see another one cruisin middle jeju island arrived crater honest pretty disappointing since crater hasnt active 1000 year shape still beside green valley technically crater course impressive youve never seen one look otherwise skip
crater
large crater filled tree expecting obvious large crater saw rather underwhelming filled tree fact crater unobvious nonetheless scenery justified short upslope walk crater
